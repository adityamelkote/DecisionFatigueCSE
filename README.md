# DecisionFatigueCSE
Avoiding Decision Fatigue with AI-Assisted Decision-Making

This is a project that uses Python to analyze movie ratings data from different sources and apply various machine learning techniques to make recommendations.

## Description

The project aims to explore the following questions:

- How do movie ratings vary across different platforms and users?
- How can we use collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users based on their preferences?
- How can we use content-based filtering to recommend movies to users based on their profile and movie features?
- How can we use hybrid filtering to combine the strengths of both methods and improve the accuracy of recommendations?

The project uses data from three sources:

- A dataset of movie ratings from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic, collected from Kaggle.
- A dataset of synthetic movie ratings generated by GPT-3.5, a large-scale language model.
- A dataset of simulated movie ratings with user information, created by Turbo User Simulator, a tool for generating realistic user behavior.

The project applies various machine learning techniques, such as:

- NextItNet, a deep neural network model for sequential recommendation.
- SVD, a matrix factorization model for collaborative filtering.
- KNN, a nearest neighbor model for content-based filtering.
- Linear Regression, a simple model for predicting ratings.

The project also uses various tools and libraries, such as:

- Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for data manipulation and analysis.
- Surprise, a Python library for building and testing recommender systems.
- Markdown, HTML, and LaTeX for writing and formatting the README file.
- readme.so, a website that helps create a README file for GitHub projects.

## Installation

To run the project, you need to have Python 3 and the required libraries installed. You can use pip to install the dependencies:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To run the project, you can use Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE. The main file is `main.ipynb`, which contains the code and explanations for each step of the project. 
Results are described in the pdf.
